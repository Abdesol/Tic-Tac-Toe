# Tic-Tac-Toe
## A Tic Tac Toe game made with a professional UI

Hello, My name is Abdella Solomon, This is a Tic Tac Toe game made by me. It is made with PyQt5.

The limitation of the game is the Computer will not play with the most accuracy. I just make it tick randomly and this will be fixed after a time.
